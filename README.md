# SAR Sign-In Assist

This is a companion program to the primary Incident Command Assistant application. The overall goal of the set of applications is to make life easier for Search and Rescue teams in Canada.

This application is designed to assist with member sign ins, by being left running perpetually on a machine. Members can use this machine (and a barcode reader if desired) to sign in generally. Those sign in records can then be sent to ICA once the task is up and running in that software.  It could also be used to sign in for a training event or other activity.
